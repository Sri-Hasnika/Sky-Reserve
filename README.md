# ✈️ Sky Reserve - Advanced Airline Reservation System Using DSA

🚀 **Sky Reserve** is an advanced airline ticket booking and management system built using **C and Data Structures**. This system efficiently handles reservations, seat allocations, and flight route optimizations using **Graphs, Min-Heaps, Linked Lists, and Queues**.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack & Data Structures Used

### **Languages & Tools:**
- **C Programming** – Core implementation language
- **Standard Libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, limits.h)**

### **Data Structures:**
- **Graph (Adjacency Matrix)** – To store and optimize flight routes
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – To find the **shortest flight route**
- **Min-Heap** – Priority-based ticket reservations
- **Linked List** – Passenger records management
- **Circular Queue** – Boarding queue management

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Book a Flight** – Reserves a flight using Min-Heap for priority booking  
✅ **Cancel a Reservation** – Removes a passenger from the linked list  
✅ **Find Shortest Flight Route** – Uses **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find optimal routes  
✅ **Display Available Flights** – Lists all flight routes stored in a **Graph**  
✅ **Boarding Queue Management** – Circular queue ensures efficient boarding  
✅ **Passenger Record Management** – Uses a linked list for efficient tracking  

## 📌 Installation & Execution
